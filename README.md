## Usage

This is a project template for [djax-cli](https://github.com/Yakima-Teng/djax-cli). **It is recommended to use npm 3+ for a more efficient dependency tree.**

``` bash
$ npm install -g djax-cli
$ djax init default my-project
$ cd my-project
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

This will scaffold the project using the template files in `master` branch.

The development server will run on port 8080 by default. If that port is already in use on your machine, the next free port will be used.

## Fork It And Make Your Own

This project can not satisfy anyone. You can fork this repo to create your own boilerplate, and use it with `djax-cli`:

```

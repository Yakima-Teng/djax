# Introduction

This boilerplate is targeted towards small-or-medium, serious projects and assumes you are somewhat familiar with `gulp`, `pug` and `sass`.

[gulp](https://gulpjs.com/)
> gulp is a toolkit for automating painful or time-consuming tasks in your development workflow, so you can stop messing around and build something.

[sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
> sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.

[pug](https://pugjs.org)
> pug is a clean, whitespace-sensitive template language for writing HTML, formerly known as "Jade".

## Quickstart

To use this template, scaffold a project with [djax-cli](https://github.com/Yakima-Teng/djax-cli). **It is recommended to use npm 3+ for a more efficient dependency tree.**

``` bash
  npm install -g djax-cli
  djax init default my-project
  cd my-project
  npm install
  npm run dev
```
